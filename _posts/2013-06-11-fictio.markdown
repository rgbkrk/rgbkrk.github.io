I love books. Really love books.

Amazon and used book stores make the most money off of me.


## Proposal

Create open source software to allow used book stores to rapidly bring in more used books, while maintaining inventory.

In reality, my wife and I would love to start a used book store and coffee shop. Seeing as I have a coding career ahead of me (and no capital), I'm just going to start building this.
