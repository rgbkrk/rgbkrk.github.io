Hey there! I'm Kyle Kelley, programmer, sometimes mathematician, oftentimes ops. I work for Rackspace, hoping to foster Developer Experience. It's my pleasure to work on open source in ways that benefit communities, open source projects, and the companies that rely on and support the tooling. As part of this, I work on [IPython](http://ipython.org) and the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) project.

My primary interests right now are:

* Creating [ephemeral execution and analytic environments](https://github.com/jupyter/tmpnb)
* Maintaining effective ways to [share content amongst a community](http://nbviewer.ipython.org)
* [Securing tools](https://speakerdeck.com/rgbkrk/one-weird-kernel-trick-hijacking-ipython-websockets) for everyone, [regardless of background](https://speakerdeck.com/rgbkrk/is-this-your-pipe-hijacking-the-build-pipeline)
